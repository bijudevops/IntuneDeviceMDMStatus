## What the Script Checks

The script performs 7 comprehensive checks:

1. **Intune Management Extension Service** - Checks if the IME service exists and is running
2. **Intune Management Extension Registry Keys** - Verifies IME registry configuration
3. **Intune Management Extension Scheduled Tasks** - Looks for IME maintenance tasks
4. **Device Enrollment Status** - Checks if the device is enrolled in Intune
5. **Intune Policies Registry** - Examines policy management configuration
6. **Intune Client Certificates** - Looks for Intune-related certificates
7. **Intune Management Extension Files** - Verifies IME installation files

## Output Interpretation

### Status Levels
- **ðŸŸ¢ DEVICE IS INTUNE MANAGED** (80-100% confidence)
  - All major Intune components are present and functional
  - Device is properly managed by Intune

- **ðŸŸ¡ DEVICE LIKELY INTUNE MANAGED** (50-79% confidence)
  - Some Intune components are present
  - May have partial management or configuration issues

- **ðŸ”´ DEVICE IS NOT INTUNE MANAGED** (0-49% confidence)
  - Few or no Intune components found
  - Device is not managed by Intune

### Confidence Scoring
The script calculates a confidence percentage based on the number of positive indicators found:
- **High Confidence (80-100%)**: Device is definitely Intune managed
- **Medium Confidence (50-79%)**: Device likely has some Intune management
- **Low Confidence (0-49%)**: Device is not Intune managed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Access Denied" Errors**
   - Check if User Account Control (UAC) is blocking access
   - Some checks may require elevated privileges for full functionality

2. **Execution Policy Restrictions**
   - Use `Set-ExecutionPolicy` to allow script execution
   - Consider using `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` for one-time execution

3. **Script Not Found**
   - Ensure you're in the correct directory
   - Use full path if running from different location

### When Results Are Unclear

- **Medium confidence results**: Check the Intune portal for device status
- **Missing components**: Verify Intune Management Extension installation
- **Service issues**: Check Windows Event Viewer for IME-related errors

## Integration

The script returns a PowerShell object that can be used in other scripts:

```powershell
$result = .\Check-IntuneDeviceStatus.ps1
if ($result.IsIntuneManaged) {
    Write-Host "Device is Intune managed with $($result.ConfidencePercentage)% confidence"
}
```

## Security Considerations

- The script reads system information and does not modify any settings
- All registry access is read-only
- No network communication is performed
- Some checks may require elevated privileges for full functionality

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Verify PowerShell version and execution policy
3. Check if elevated privileges are needed for specific checks
4. Review Windows Event Viewer for related errors
